# Change Log

All notable changes to the "Translate i18n by l10n.dev" extension will be documented in this file.

## [1.14.1] — 2026-11-09

### Changed
- 💳 **Subscription plans**: l10n.dev now uses monthly subscription plans instead of a monthly free allowance and pay-as-you-go packages. New users get a 3-day free trial with 10,000 characters.
  - The welcome notification describes the free trial (it previously offered 30,000 free characters every month) and has a new **View Plans** button that opens [l10n.dev/#pricing](https://l10n.dev/#pricing).
  - The README's Getting Started, Pricing and Troubleshooting sections describe the trial and the monthly plans, and link to the pricing page for current prices in your currency.
  - When a translation fails because there are not enough characters left, the message now suggests upgrading the plan or renewing early on the Billing page (unused characters carry over), not buying more characters. The built-in MCP server gives agents the same advice.
- The Marketplace pricing label is now **Free Trial** (`"pricing": "Trial"`) instead of **Free**.

### Technical Details
- Updated [ai-l10n-sdk](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ai-l10n-sdk) to v1.12.1 and the bundled [ai-l10n-mcp](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ai-l10n-mcp) server to v1.2.1

## [1.14.0] — 2026-08-13

### Added
- 🔍 **Language codes inside file names are detected**: projects that keep the language code next to other parts of the file name — `emails.en.json`, `emails-en.json`, `en-US.common.json`, `common.en-Latn-US.yml`, `messages_en_US.properties` — are now recognized as file-based structures. Previously they resolved to an unknown structure, so no target languages were offered and translation failed with *"No target languages found"*.
  - Sibling files following the same pattern become the detected target languages: `emails.en.json` next to `emails.es.json` and `emails.fr.json` offers `es` and `fr`, while `common.de.json` is ignored.
  - Target files replace the code instead of appending it: `email.en.json` → Russian is saved as `email.ru-RU.json` (previously `email.en.ru-RU.json`), and the separator style is preserved, so `messages_en_US.properties` → `messages_ru_RU.properties`.
  - Detection only runs after the folder-based and file-based checks fail, and every subtag is validated against the bundled ISO code sets, so names like `strings.min.json` or `config.dev.json` are left alone.
- 🤖 **MCP server**: `l10n_detect_project_structure` reports these projects as `file-based` with the detected file name pattern (e.g. `emails.{language}.json`), and both `l10n_detect_project_structure` and `l10n_translate_file` accept a `languageCodeRegex` input for naming conventions that are not detected automatically. `l10n_setup_automation` writes that regex into the generated `ai-l10n.config.json` when the project needs it.

### Changed
- When the whole file name parses as a language code only by coincidence, an embedded code now wins: `app-en.json` is read as `en` with the prefix `app-` (producing `app-fr.json`) instead of as the language `app-en` (which produced `fr.json` and dropped the prefix). Whole-name codes whose subtags are not in the bundled ISO sets, such as `bal-PK.json`, keep their previous interpretation.

### Technical Details
- Updated [ai-l10n-sdk](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ai-l10n-sdk) to v1.12.0 and the bundled [ai-l10n-mcp](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ai-l10n-mcp) server to v1.2.0
- Development dependencies (TypeScript, ESLint, typescript-eslint, esbuild, sinon) updated to their latest compatible versions

## [1.13.0] — 2026-07-27

### Added
- 🤖 **Built-in MCP Server**: The [ai-l10n MCP server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ai-l10n-mcp) now ships with the extension and is offered to Chat automatically — no `mcp.json` editing required. Open Chat in agent mode and the `l10n.dev` server is already there with the `l10n_*` tools (translate files, detect project structure, manage glossaries and linguistic instructions, check balance).
- 🔐 **No API Key in config files**: The key stored in VS Code's secrets manager is injected into the server process as `L10N_API_KEY` when it starts, so it never lands in a JSON file. If you haven't set one in the extension, the server falls back to its own stored key (`~/.ai-l10n/config.json`) or its `l10n_set_api_key` tool, exactly as it does outside VS Code.

### Configuration
- **l10n-translate-i18n.enableMcpServer**: Provide the built-in MCP server to Chat (default: true). Disable it if you configure `ai-l10n-mcp` manually in `mcp.json`.

### Technical Details
- Contributes `mcpServerDefinitionProviders` (id `l10nDevMcpProvider`) and registers it via `vscode.lm.registerMcpServerDefinitionProvider` during activation
- `ai-l10n-mcp` v1.1.2 is bundled into `dist/mcp-server.js` and launched with the editor's own Node runtime — works offline, and Node/npx are not required on your PATH
- The server list refreshes automatically when the API Key or the `enableMcpServer` setting changes — no window reload needed
- Note: because the extension contributes an MCP provider, VS Code may now activate it when discovering MCP servers, not only when a localization file is opened

## [1.12.1] — 2026-07-13

- Usage details are added to the Translation complete notification

## [1.12.0] - 2026-06-25

### Changed
- **User Experience**: When a target file exists, users are presented with a clear dialog offering three options: "Translate Only New Strings", "Replace Existing File", "Create New File", or "Cancel"
- When `Translate Only New Strings` is selected, the fileName is used as a scope to determine which strings are considered new/changed. It allows for more granular control over which strings are translated. 

## [1.11.1] - 2026-06-15

### Changed
- Updated README

## [1.11.0] - 2026-06-02

### Added
- **AI Glossary Generation** — New `generateGlossary` option (config: `generateGlossary: true`) that generates a translation glossary from source and target content and saves it as the active glossary for this language pair, improving consistency across future translations.

### Configuration
- **l10n-translate-i18n.generateGlossary** - When is enabled it automatically builds a glossary with AI.

## [1.10.2] - 2026-05-05

### Fixed
- 🐛 **Translation Error Handling**: remove redundant error logging in translation command.

## [1.10.1] - 2026-05-05

### Fixed
- 🐛 **Translation Error Handling**: `performTranslation` was returning `false` even on successful translations due to a suppressed error path — error messages are now properly surfaced to the user when translation fails

## [1.10.0] - 2026-04-21

### Changed
- 📦 **SDK Update**: Upgraded to [ai-l10n-sdk](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ai-l10n-sdk) v1.5.1 for structured API responses
- 🔄 **Structured Error Handling**: `translate()` now returns a typed `ApiResponse` discriminated union instead of throwing — errors are surfaced with a `reason` and `message` rather than exceptions
- 🔍 **Language Search Resilience**: Language search (`predictLanguages`) now returns a structured response — network errors are handled gracefully and shown as a warning instead of crashing

### Technical Details
- `translate()` return type changed from `TranslationResult | null` to `TranslationResponse` (`ApiResponse<TranslationResult> & { currentBalance?: number }`)
- `remainingBalance` on `TranslationResult` replaced by `currentBalance` on `TranslationResponse`
- `predictLanguages()` return type changed from `Language[]` (throwing) to `ApiResponse<Language[]>` (never throws)

### Configuration
- **l10n-translate-i18n.saveFilteredStrings**: Save filtered strings to separate files (default: true)

### Notes
- **Content Policy**: Filtered strings are those that violated [l10n.dev content policies](https://l10n.dev/terms-of-service#content-policy)
- **Length Limits**: When AI context limits are reached, untranslated strings are saved to filtered files
- **Batch Translation**: Filtering works seamlessly with parallel batch translations without interrupting the workflow

## [1.5.1] - 2025-11-17

### Changed
- ⚡ **Parallel Translation Processing**: Translations to multiple languages now execute in parallel instead of sequentially, significantly reducing total translation time
- 🚀 **Performance Improvement**: When translating to all languages, all API requests are now sent simultaneously, making the process much faster

### Technical Details
- Replaced sequential for-loop with `Promise.all()` for concurrent translation execution
- Each language translation runs independently without waiting for others to complete
- Error handling remains robust with individual language failures not affecting others

## [1.5.0] - 2025-11-11

### Added
- 🌍 **Translate to All Languages**: New option to translate to all detected languages at once with a single command
- ⚡ **Batch Translation Preference**: When translating to multiple languages, set your preference once (update existing or create new files) instead of choosing for each file
- 📊 **Batch Translation Summary**: See a summary of successful and failed translations when translating to multiple languages

### Changed
- 🎯 **Enhanced Language Selection**: Language picker now shows "Translate to All Languages" option when multiple languages are detected
- 🔄 **Optimized Workflow**: "Translate Only New Strings" preference is asked once upfront for batch translations instead of for each file

### Notes
- **Perfect for Multi-Language Projects**: Quickly translate your source file to all project languages in one go
- **Smart Conflict Handling**: Choose once how to handle existing files—update them or create new copies

## [1.4.0] - 2025-10-27

### Added
- 🎯 **Flutter Localization Support**: Full support for ARB (Application Resource Bundle) files used in Flutter applications
- 📱 **ARB File Translation**: New `Translate ARB to...` command specifically for ARB files
- 🔄 **Automatic ARB Metadata Updates**: The l10n.dev API automatically updates `@@locale` to the target language code and `@@last_modified` to current UTC timestamp
- 🏷️ **Custom Prefix Support**: ARB files with custom prefixes (e.g., `app_en_US.arb`, `my_app_fr.arb`) are automatically handled
- 📊 **Remaining Balance Display**: Translation success notification now shows remaining character balance after translation
- 🔤 **Underscore Format**: ARB files use underscores for language codes (e.g., `en_US`) instead of hyphens

### Changed
- 🔧 **Enhanced Language Detection**: Updated project structure detection to support both JSON (hyphen-based) and ARB (underscore-based) file naming conventions
- 📁 **Smart File Naming**: Automatically generates correct target file names based on file type (JSON vs ARB) and detected naming patterns
- ⚙️ **Language Code Validation**: Added separate validation for ARB format language codes with underscores
- 💬 **Improved Notifications**: Character usage now displays with thousands separators for better readability

### Notes
- **ARB vs JSON**: Use `Translate ARB to...` for Flutter ARB files and `Translate JSON to...` for standard i18n JSON files
- **File Format Detection**: The extension automatically detects file type based on extension (.arb or .json)
- **Backward Compatible**: All existing JSON translation functionality remains unchanged

## [1.3.0] - 2025-10-21

### Added
- 🔄 **Translate Only New Strings**: Added smart update mode that detects existing target files and prompts users to either translate only new strings or create a new file
- 📝 **Incremental Translation Support**: When translating only new strings, the extension reads the existing target file and sends both source and target to the API, which returns an updated translation with only the new strings translated
- 🎯 **Flexible File Management**: Users can choose between updating existing translations or creating new files with copy numbers (e.g., `es (1).json`)

### Changed
- 🔧 **Enhanced Translation Request**: Added `translateOnlyNewStrings` and `targetStrings` properties to support incremental translations
- 💾 **Smart File Saving**: Implemented logic to replace existing files when updating translations or generate unique filenames when creating new copies

### Notes
- **Backward Compatible**: No breaking changes - existing functionality remains unchanged
- ⚠️ **Array Handling Warning**: When using "Translate Only New Strings" with JSON arrays, ensure array indexes match between source and target files. Always append new items to the end of arrays. Object-based JSON structures (recommended for i18n) don't have this limitation as they match by key names.
- **User Experience**: When a target file exists, users are presented with a clear dialog offering three options: "Translate Only New Strings", "Create New File", or "Cancel"

## [1.2.0] - 2025-09-22

### Added
- ✨ **String Output Format**: Implemented `returnTranslationsAsString` feature that returns translations as stringified JSON
- 🔧 **Preserved Structure**: Maintains original JSON structure and key ordering in translated output
- ⚡ **Optimized Performance**: Eliminates the need for additional JSON.stringify() operations on the client side

### Changed
- 🔄 **API Integration**: Updated translation request interface to always use `returnTranslationsAsString: true`
- 📦 **Internal Optimization**: Streamlined translation output handling for better performance

### Notes
- **Always Enabled**: The `returnTranslationsAsString` feature is permanently enabled for the extension to ensure consistent behavior
- **Backward Compatible**: No breaking changes - existing functionality remains unchanged

## [1.1.0] - 2025-09-05

### Added
- ✨ **Generate Additional Plural Forms**: The new `generatePluralForms` setting enables automatic creation of all required plural form strings for languages with complex pluralization rules (e.g., Russian, Arabic, Polish).
- ⚙️ **Improved i18next Compatibility**: Designed specifically for i18next and similar frameworks that need accurate plural form handling.
- 🔧 **New Configuration Setting**: `l10n-translate-i18n.generatePluralForms` (default: false)

### Changed
- 📖 **Updated Documentation**: Enhanced README with plural forms configuration details.
- ⚡ **API Integration**: Updated translation request interface to support the new generatePluralForms property.

### Notes
- **Important**: Do not enable `generatePluralForms` for strict source-to-target mapping projects as it generates additional plural suffixes (extra keys not present in the source file).
- **Use Case**: This feature is specifically designed for i18next and similar frameworks that handle plural forms.
